# Open positions

Thank you for your interest in joining the Sanders Lab.

## Undergraduate and graduate students

If you are interested in a rotation in the CSDA Lab, please contact Dr. Cohen (acohen@uwf.edu) or Dr. Pu (spu@uwf.edu). We are primarily a data science lab working on data-driven methods, statistical modeling, computational mathematics, predictive models, and machine learning methods. So a background in coding helps students make the most of their experience.
