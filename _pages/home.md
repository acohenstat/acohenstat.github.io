**The Computation Statistics and Data Analytics Lab (CSDA)** is a multidisciplinary group working on applications of applied mathematics, statistics, and data science. There are four main areas of research:

1. **Statistical modeling**: Applying statistics to solve various and multidisciplinary problems including Biology, Chemistry, Education, Sports, Health, to name a few.
2. **Statistical process monitoring**: Developing and evaluating statistical methods used in system monitoring. 
3. **Neuroscience**: Leveraging data science / statistical techniques to understand the memory in monkeys. 
4. **Probability distributions**: Studying and investigating new probability distributions


### Technologies and methods
The CSDA Lab is primarily a data analytics group that uses a wide range of statistical and mathematical methods including: generalized linear mixed models, latent class analysis, hypothesis testing, imputation methods, and RStudio/R/Python.
