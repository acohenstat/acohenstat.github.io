 # Computational Statistics and Data Analytics Lab at UWF


**CSDA** (Computational Statistics and Data Analytics) is a **student-centered** research group in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, the Hal Marcus College of Science and Engineering at the University of West Florida, working on research projects in data science, statistical process monitoring, computational neuroscience, probability distributions, and applied machine learning.<br>


There are four main areas of research:

1. **Statistical modeling**: Applying statistics to solve various and multidisciplinary problems including Biology, Chemistry, Education, Sports, Health, to name a few.
2. **Statistical process monitoring**: Developing and evaluating statistical methods used in system monitoring. 
3. **Neuroscience**: Leveraging machine learning / statistical techniques to understand the brain neurons connections. 
4. **Probability distributions**: Studying and investigating new probability distributions.


### Technologies and methods
The CSDA Lab is primarily a data analytics group that uses a wide range of statistical and mathematical methods including: generalized linear mixed models, latent class analysis, hypothesis testing, imputation methods, and RStudio/R/Python.
