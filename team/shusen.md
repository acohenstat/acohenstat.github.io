### Overview

Dr. Shusen Pu joined the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at UWF as an Assistant Professor in 2022. He received his Ph.D. in applied mathematics from Case Western Reserve University in 2020. Before joining UWF, Dr. Pu worked as a Lecturer in the Department of Mathematics at Vanderbilt University.


### Short description of your current research project:


His recent research focuses on *mathematical biology*, especially *computational neuroscience*, and *experimental data analysis*. In the long term, his research aims to close the gap between microscopic level activities and their associated macroscopic behaviors. Dr. Pu worked on a diverse set of problems, including computational properties of single neuron activities, neural network models, working memory, and stochastic processes in biological systems. Additionally, Dr. Pu collaborates closely with biologists to analyze experimental data to leverage the power of computation for physical explorations. Dr. Pu also conducts research in statistics, where he works on generalized distributions and their applications to real-life data.

Dr. Pu published in Neural Computation, Eneuro, Biological Cybernetics, Data Science and other peer-reviewed journals. He has reviewed publications in multiple areas, including multidisciplinary journals such as iScience (Cell Press). Dr. Pu is actively organizing conference sessions and workshops. In addition, he presented his work at academic conferences in Canada, China, and the USA.
