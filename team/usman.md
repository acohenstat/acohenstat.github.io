### Short description of your current research project:

Future of Data Science (Emerging Technology Trends: A Prescriptive Analytics on Large Data Set of Research Databases)

This undertaking analyses the evolution of Emerging Technologies around the globe, using the predictions made in the Horizon Report, published yearly from 2004, MIT Technology review and predictions made by Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). This research applies social evaluation, primarily based on Google Trends, and Bibliometric analysis, with data of scientific publications from IEEE, MIT, Questia online Library, JSTOR, Springer, Hindawi and Web of Science, with a purpose to discover which technology had been a hit and sincerely impacted mainstream training, and which one failed to have the anticipated impact. This mission gives guidelines that can be beneficial to those who are looking forward to investing in new research regions.
