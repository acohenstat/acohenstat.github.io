### Short description of your current research project:
Veterans are proudly honored in this country for their dedication and sacrifice. Many veterans struggle to readjust to life after active duty though. More specifically, veterans who sustain a service connected disability. This can include either a physical or mental disability that occurred during active service. Pre-existing injuries that were exaggerated faster than normal progression is also tied to a service connected disability. Their recovery and rehabilitation can be a long process and even harder without support. 
Disability is a term hard to define, but it is essentially a permanent impairment to the body or mind that makes certain activities for those individuals limited, unless modified (Altman 2001). There are many types and factors that constitute a classification of “disabled”. For this project we specifically looked into veterans and their service connected disability (SCD). SCD includes post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance abuse (Wilmoth 2015). The Veterans Affairs Schedule for Rating Disabilities (VASRD) is used when evaluating a disability. The severity of a disability is measured on a percentage scale depending how much one's overall health and function is decreased. The scale is from 0 percent to 100 percent and goes in 10 percent increments (Miller 2015). The assigned percentage is then used to determine how much one is eligible for in compensation. 

The purpose of this research was to understand how the disability compensation of veterans is associated with their service connected disability rating and the quality of life they can live.
