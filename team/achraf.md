### Short description of your current research project:


His research focus is situated in *statistical process monitoring* (SPM). In the context of his work, SPM refers to the statistical techniques, tools, and practices that improve system monitoring and statistical quality control models. One of the best ways to develop a monitoring system is to combine the three schools of thought in the literature, which are (1) statistical approach (a.k.a. SPM), which is concerned with collecting data from processes to develop statistical monitoring models, (2) knowledge-based approach that is based on expertsâ€™ knowledge and their expertise, and (3) model-based approach that requires a prior physical and mathematical description of the process. Any description (data, expert, and physical/mathematical knowledge) of the process provides new information and reinforces system understanding. In particular, my research focuses on statistical models for process monitoring.

In addition to SPM, his research interests are also in *statistical modeling and applications / data science* (inferences, machine learning, and predictive models).
